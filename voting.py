Voting System

Task:
- Implement a simple voting system.
- Store candidates in a dictionary { "candidate_name": vote_count }
- Allow voters (by ID) to vote only once.
- Use *args to register multiple candidates at once.
- Use **kwargs to update candidate details like party, region.


// NOT FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT
Future OOP Extension:
- Candidate as a class.
- Voter as a class with has_voted flag.
- Election as a manager class.
